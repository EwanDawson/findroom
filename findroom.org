#+TITLE: FindRoom

* Objectives
  I'm going to build an application to allow users to book meeting rooms in CodeBase. The application will provide the following features:
  - Users can find a list of available rooms that meet the users criteria, such as:
    - time (start/end time, or start time and duration)
    - room size (number of seats required)
    - equipment required (whiteboard, TV)
    - floor

* Technology
  I want to try building this using Datomic Ions running on AWS. Based on my calculations, this will cost about Â£27 per month in software and infrastructure fees.
  Once I've built this using Datomic Ions, I should have learned enough about Clojure, Datomic and AWS to reimplement it on a cheaper platform.

* Setting Up
  I followed the instructions on the Datomic Cloud Documentation pages:
  - [[https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/setting-up.html][Setting Up]]
  - [[https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/getting-started/configuring-access.html][user Access]]
** AWS Account
   I will run this in my AWS account https://480816403005.signin.aws.amazon.com/console (login ~ewan~).
** EC2 Key Pair
   I created a new keypair for Frankfurt region: [[file:ewan-frankfurt.pem][ewan-frankfurt.pem]] 
** Datomic Cloud
   Purchased a ~solo~ instance, and deployed to a Cloud Formation Stack named ~ichigo~.
*** CloudFormation
    [[https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-central-1#/stacks?tab=events&filter=active][The CloudFormation Stacks for ichigo]]
*** CloudWatch Dashboard
    [[https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-central-1#dashboards:name=datomic-ichigo-eu-central-1][The CloudWatch Dashboard for ichigo]]

* Getting Started
  Following the [[https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/getting-started/connecting.html][Getting Started]] instructions on the Datomic Cloud Documnetation pages.
** Clojure
   I installed ~clojure 1.9.0~ to my local profile on ~ehime~:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   nix-env -iA nixos.clojure
   #+END_SRC
** AWS CLI
   I installed ~awscli~ to my local profile on ~ehime~:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   nix-env -i awscli
   #+END_SRC
** SOCKS Proxy
   Downloaded the ~datomic-socks-proxy~ script and started it with:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   bash datomic-socks-proxy ichigo 
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:

   Successfully verified the SOCKS connection with:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   export DATOMIC_SYSTEM=ichigo
   export DATOMIC_REGION=eu-central-1
   export DATOMIC_SOCKS_PORT=8182

   curl -x socks5h://localhost:$DATOMIC_SOCKS_PORT http://entry.$DATOMIC_SYSTEM.$DATOMIC_REGION.datomic.net:8182/
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : ichigo-storagef7f305e7-1lw0plnlyyem4-s3datomic-bpowryov9sb6
